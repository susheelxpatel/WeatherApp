Challenge Title: Flutter Weather App with WeatherAPI Integration

Challenge Description:

Objective: Develop a Flutter mobile application that retrieves weather data from 
WeatherAPI and displays it on the home page for different cities (you can choose any 
free WeatherAPI). 
Additionally, implement a settings page to allow users to switch between dark and light 
themes. 
Use the Provider state management, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern, 
and integrate the WeatherAPI for real-time weather information.

Modules:
1. Application Setup:
 - Create a Flutter project for building the mobile application.
 - Set up the necessary dependencies, including Provider for state management.
2. WeatherAPI Integration:
 - Integrate WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data for different cities.
 - Implement methods to retrieve weather information based on city names.
3. Home Page:
 - Design a home page that displays the weather of different cities.
 - Use a ListView or GridView to show a list/grid of cities with their current weather 
details.
- Implement UI elements to display temperature, weather conditions, and other 
relevant information.
4. Settings Page:
 - Create a settings page where users can switch between dark and light themes.
 - Utilize Provider to manage the app's theme state.
5. MVC Architecture:
 - Implement the MVC architecture pattern to organize code into models, views, and 
controllers.
 - Separate logic related to data fetching (Model), UI (View), and state management 
(Controller).
6. Theme Management:
 - Use Flutter's theme capabilities to apply dark and light themes throughout the app.
 - Ensure that the theme changes dynamically when the user switches between dark 
and light modes.
7. Error Handling:
 - Implement error handling mechanisms for scenarios such as failed API requests or 
network issues.
 - Provide informative error messages to the user.

Note:  I have done all the modules.
